## About

Azure is an instrument that examines humankind’s relationship with animals and man-made destruction through the lens of the Chernobyl disaster. This instrument combines Unity and SuperCollider, allowing audience members to watch and listen as the reactors overload and explode on screen in a cacophony of sight and sound. The audience is immersed in the audio of a clicking Geiger counter. They can explore the famous Pripyat pool. The audience triggers the explosion, implying humans' role in the Chernobyl disaster. But the audience is also trapped, unable to do anything as the explosion occurs. After the disaster, humans left the area, allowing animals to return as signified by the howling of the growing wolf populations. Audience members can see how the landscape changed after the reactors exploded. 
Through Azure, we encourage the audience to critically think about humanity’s negative impact on nature and in what ways the absence of human intervention might affect nature’s resurgence.
In the future, we imagine Azure to be an installation where audience members have free-range in exploring the sights and sounds of Pripyat before and after the Chernobyl disaster.
